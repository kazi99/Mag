    abstract = {We present a detailed study of elliptic fibrations on Fourier-Mukai partners of K3 surfaces, which we call derived elliptic structures. We fully classify derived elliptic structures in terms of Hodge-theoretic data, similar to the Derived Torelli Theorem that describes Fourier-Mukai partners. In Picard rank two, derived elliptic structures are fully determined by the Lagrangian subgroups of the discriminant group. As a consequence, we prove that for a large class of Picard rank 2 elliptic K3 surfaces all Fourier-Mukai partners are Jacobians, and we partially extend this result to non-closed fields. We also show that there exist elliptic K3 surfaces with Fourier-Mukai partners, which are not Jacobians of the original K3 surface. This gives a negative answer to a question raised by Hassett and Tschinkel.},
