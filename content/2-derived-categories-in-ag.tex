\section{Derived categories in geometry}

One of the main invariants of a scheme $X$ over $k$ is its category of coherent sheaves $\coherent{X}$. One can think of this category as a slight expansion of the category of $k$-vector bundles on $X$ in the sense that $\coherent{X}$ is abelian, where as the former very often is not. In this chapter we restrict ourself to noetherian schemes and our primary object of study will be the bounded derived category of coherent sheaves
\[
    D^b(X) := D^b(\coherent{X}).
\]
