\subsubsection{Cohomology}
\subsubsection{Intersection pairing}

\begin{proposition}
    \label{intersection pairing on K3 is even}
    Let $X$ be a K3 surface. Then the intersection pairing on $H^2(X, \Z)$ given by the $\smallsmile$-product is an even lattice. 
\end{proposition}

\subsubsection{Hodge structure}

\subsection{Two important theorems}

\begin{theorem}
    \label{Classical Torelli theorem}
\end{theorem}

\begin{remark}
    For a topological space $X$ we will distinguish between the collection of all cohomology groups, considered concisely as a graded object $\cohom{\bullet}{X}{\Z} = \bigoplus_n \cohom{n}{X}{\Z}$, and its (graded) cohomology ring, which we will denote by $\cohom{*}{X}{\Z}$.
\end{remark}
