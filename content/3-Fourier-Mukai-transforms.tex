\begin{theorem}[\text{\cite[Theorem 2.2]{Orlov-K3}}]
    \label{Orlov's theorem}
    Let $X$ and $Y$ be smooth projective varieties over a field $k$. Suppose $F \colon \derb{X} \to \derb{Y}$ is a fully faithful functor admitting a right (and, consequently, the left) adjoint functor. Then there exists up to an isomorphism a unique object $E$ of $\derb{X \times Y}$ such that $F$ and $\fm{E}$ are naturally isomorphic.
